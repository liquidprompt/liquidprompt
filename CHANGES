	New features:
	- Workaround broken .bashrc that export PROMPT_COMMAND (GH #450, #463):
	  we now unexport it on startup
	- Allow to customize the symbol before the path that shows if the
	  directory is writable: LP_MARK_PERM (GitHub #430, #484)
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix regression in LP_ENABLE_FQDN implementation (GitHub #472)
	- Fix LP_COLOR_HOST_HASH on SunOS (GitHub #461, #462)
	- Fix LP_MARK_DEFAULT being ignored if root (GitHub #501)
	- Git:
	  * Faster "git stash" check (GitHub #503)

1.11    2016-06-25
	Bug fixes:
	- OS X: sudo feature fixed
	- OS X: battery level restored

1.10    2016-05-30
	Breaking changes:
	- In themes, LP_COLORMAP_x variables are replaced by a single
	  LP_COLORMAP array variable. A warning will be displayed at startup
	  if your config still uses the old variables, but a compatibility
	  shim is active (will be removed in next release).
	- Many LP_ENABLE_* settings are now static (their effect applies when
	  liquidprompt is loaded, and changing them at the prompt does nothing)
	  to more and more improve speed.
	- zsh: option 'nopromptsubst' is enabled for security reasons.
          This will unfortunately also affect evaluations of other prompt
	  contexts such as RPS1.
	- Variables LP_SCREEN_TITLE_OPEN and LP_SCREEN_TITLE_CLOSE are now
          removed to simplify the code (GitHub #371)
	New features:
	- Sudo:
	    * The color of the prompt mark is now dynamic and changes to
	      LP_COLOR_MARK_SUDO (default: bold red) as long as your sudo
	      credentials are cached (GitHub #335).
	      Requires sudo 1.7.0+.
	      This feature must be enabled with LP_ENABLE_SUDO=1
	      Use 'sudo -K' to revoke your credentials early.
	    * This feature is disabled by default as there is no way to
	      detect if the user has sudo rights without triggering a security
	      alert that will annoy the sysadmin.
	- Git:
	    * Show the number of commits behind the remote (GitHub #269)
	    * Show the rebasing/merging/cherry-picking state (GitHub #409)
	- Add variable LP_TTYN: the basename of the terminal (GitHub #357)
	- Add setting LP_ENABLE_FQDN to show the fully qualified domain name
	  of the host (GitHub #254, #277)
        - LP_HOSTNAME_ALWAYS=-1 to always hide the hostname (GitHub #406)
	- Run duration of the last command (LP_ENABLE_RUNTIME) is now also
	  supported on zsh (GitHub #404, #355)
	- Python: add support for Conda (CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV) (GitHub #425)
	Bug fixes:
	- Use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME to locate the config (GitHub #415, #420, #425)
	- Improved zsh integration (but most issues had no impact of the
	  user experience)
	- Fix escaping of special chars from $PWD (well, almost, see GitHub
	  #389) and explicitely set the shell options we need (instead of
	  relying on the shell default settings)
	- Git:
	    * Fix typo in git work directory detection
	- Fossil:
	    * Fix on darwin (GitHub #390)
	- LP_DISABLED_VCS_PATH is fixed on zsh (GitHub #423)
	- Battery indicator:
	    * MacOS: many fixes to handle (all?) edge cases (GitHub #326)
	      We now have a pmset simulator to better detect regressions.
	- Temperature indicator:
	    * The code using the 'sensors' command now uses the '-u' option
	      ("raw output") that is easier to parse. This format is at least
	      7 years old. (GitHub #379, #380)
	    * We now try each backend (acpi/sensors) once to check it works
	      at startup and disable the feature if none works.
	      (GitHub #410, #319, #381, #387)
	- CPU load indicator:
	    * Fix the scale that was incorrectly 0-200 (GitHub #391)
	- Title:
	    * Fix terminal sequences that were sent in the title text (the
	      escaping algorithm is rewritten and now just correct).
	- Terminal channel:
	    * Fix detection of tmux (GitHub #304, #377)
            * Fix detection of local session on OS X (GitHub #407)
	- Misc:
	    * Fix bash 3 compatibility (GitHub #313)
	    * Clear GREP_OPTIONS and skip 'grep' aliases (GitHub #372)
	- Shortened path:
	    * Fix bugs when $PWD contains spaces or special chars (GitHub #369)
	    * Optimize implementation in case of LP_PATH_KEEP=-1 : LP_PWD
	      becomes static (related to GitHub #256, #336)
	    * Optimize implementation in case LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH=0
	    * Optimize implementation in case LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH=0 on bash
	      with PROMPT_DIRTRIM
	- Sample configuration files:
	    * example.bashrc: major fixes
	- The last statement of liquidprompt did not return 0 (GitHub #360,#361)
	- Analog clock:
	    * complete rewrite for speed and correctness (GitHub #365 and other
	      issues)
	- Documentation:
	    * Many small fixes
	- Move dist/ to contrib/dist/ as files there are unmaintained
	- Fix title escapes in zsh inside tmux/screen (GitHub #370, #371)
