1.10    201?-??-??
	New features:
	- Sudo:
	    * The color of the prompt mark is now dynamic and changes to
	      LP_COLOR_MARK_SUDO (default: bold red) as long as your sudo
	      credentials are cached (GitHub #335).
	      Requires sudo 1.7.0+.
	      This feature can be disabled with LP_ENABLE_SUDO=0 (as this is
	      one more thing that slows the prompt).
	      Use 'sudo -K' to revoke your credentials early.
	    * This feature is disabled by default as there is no way to
	      detect if the user has sudo rights without triggering a security
	      alert that will annoy the sysadmin.
	- Git:
	    * Also show the number of commits behind the remote (GitHub #269)
	- Add variable LP_TTYN: the basename of the terminal (GitHub #357)
	- Add setting LP_ENABLE_FQDN to show the fully qualified domain name
	  of the host (GitHub #254, #277)
        - LP_HOSTNAME_ALWAYS=-1 to always hide the hostname (GitHub #406)
	- Run duration of the last command (LP_ENABLE_RUNTIME) is now also
	  supported on zsh (GitHub #404, #355)
	Incompatible changes:
	- Variables LP_SCREEN_TITLE_OPEN and LP_SCREEN_TITLE_CLOSE are now
          removed to simplify the code (GitHub #371)
	Bug fixes:
	- Git:
	    * Fix typo in git work directory detection
	- Fossil:
	    * Fix on darwin (GitHub #390)
	- Battery indicator:
	    * MacOS: many fixes to handle (all?) edge cases (GitHub #326)
	      We now have a pmset simulator to better detect regressions.
	- Temperature indicator:
	    * The code using the 'sensors' command now uses the '-u' option
	      ("raw output") that is easier to parse. This format is at least
	      7 years old. (GitHub #379, #380)
	- CPU load indicator:
	    * Fix the scale that was incorrectly 0-200 (GitHub #391)
	- Title:
	    * Fix terminal sequences that were sent in the title text (the
	      escaping algorithm is rewritten and now just correct).
	- Terminal channel:
	    * Fix detection of tmux (GitHub #304, #377)
	- Misc:
	    * Fix bash 3 compatibility (GitHub #313)
	    * Clear GREP_OPTIONS and skip 'grep' aliases (GitHub #372)
	- Shortened path:
	    * Fix bugs when $PWD contains spaces or special chars (GitHub #369)
	- Sample configuration files:
	    * example.bashrc: major fixes
	- The last statement of liquidprompt did not return 0 (GitHub #360,#361)
	- Analog clock: fix the first hour after midnight on zsh (GitHub #365)
	- Documentation:
	    * Many small fixes
	- Move dist/ to contrib/dist/ as files there are unmaintained
	- Fix title escapes in zsh inside tmux/screen (GitHub #370, #371)
