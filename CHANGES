	New features:
	- Sudo:
	    * The color of the prompt mark is now dynamic and changes to
	      LP_COLOR_MARK_SUDO (default: bold red) as long as your sudo
	      credentials are cached (Github #335).
	      This feature can be disabled with LP_ENABLE_SUDO=0 (as this is
	      one more thing that slows the prompt).
	      Use 'sudo -K' to revoke your credentials early.
	- Git:
	    * Also show the number of commits behind the remote (Github #269)
	Bug fixes:
	- Git:
	    * Fix typo in git work directory detection
	- Battery indicator:
	    * MacOS: many fixes to handle (all?) edge cases (Github #326)
	      We now have a pmset simulator to better detect regressions.
	- Misc:
	    * Fix bash 3 compatibility (Github #313)
	- Sample configuration files:
	    * example.bashrc: major fixes
	- Documentation:
	    * Many small fixes
