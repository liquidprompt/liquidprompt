liquidprompt/contrib Policy
---------------------------

This directory contains files that have been contributed by contributors
but that the core liquidprompt maintainers don't take care.
So they are probably outdated, maybe of poor quality (because the maintainers
do not have the knowledge to properly review them).

So use them at your own risks, and don't fill issues about them, just send
patches.
