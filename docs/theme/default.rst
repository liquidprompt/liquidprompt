Default Theme

Preview
=======

If there is nothing special about the current context, the appearance of
Liquidprompt is similar to that of a default prompt:

.. image:: default-short.png
   :alt: [user:~] $

If you are running a background command and are also in the "main" branch of a
Git repository on a server:

.. image:: default-med.png
   :alt: 1& [user@server:~/liquidprompt] main ¬±

When Liquidprompt is displaying nearly everything (a rare event!), it may look
like this:

.. image:: default-long.png
   :alt: üï§ ‚åÅ24% ‚åÇ1.68 Œ∏90¬∞ 3d/2&/1z [user@server:~/ ‚Ä¶ /liquidprompt/docs/theme ‚öû3] [pyenv] main(+10/-5,+3/-1)+* 20s 125 ¬±

See :ref:`Templates <templates>` for what each section will look like.

Configuration
=============

As the default theme, all of the normal :doc:`../config` are respected.

.. attribute:: LP_PS1_FILE
   :type: string
   :value: ""

   A template file that is sourced for each prompt. Must set :attr:`LP_PS1`.
   See :ref:`Templates <templates>` for details.

.. attribute:: LP_PS1
   :type: string
   :value: ""

   If set, the default theme sets :envvar:`PS1` to this value. Not very useful
   to set it in the config, instead set it in the :attr:`LP_PS1_FILE`.

.. _templates:

Templates
=========

The default theme supports templated sections. Each piece of the theme is saved
to a variable, and can be arranged in any order in a template. If you want to
change the theme enough to move things around, but not enough to make your own
theme, templates will let you change the order of the default theme's pieces.

As the default theme of Liquidprompt was the only theme until version 2.0,
templates were sometimes referred to as "themes" in version 1.X.

For a template file to be loaded, its filepath must be set in
:attr:`LP_PS1_FILE`.

A template file does nothing more than set :attr:`LP_PS1` to a value. The
following sections are available to be used.

An example template file is available: liquid.ps1_.

Template Sections
-----------------

All of the available template sections are listed below. Their order is the
default order if the user does not configure a different template.

.. note::
   Omitting a template section from your template will **not** disable that
   feature. While it will not be displayed in the prompt, Liquidprompt does not
   know that, and will still generate that template section. If you want to
   speed up your prompt by disabling a section, you must disable it with its
   respective ``LP_ENABLE_*`` option.

:attr:`LP_PS1_PREFIX`:

   Not actually a part of the default theme, it is used in the default template
   as the starting section. See :attr:`LP_PS1_PREFIX` and :func:`prompt_tag`
   for details.
