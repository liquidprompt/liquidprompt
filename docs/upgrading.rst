Upgrading Liquidprompt
**********************

We try our best to make new versions of Liquidprompt backwards compatible with
previous versions, but sometimes things need to change to make forward progress.
If a version introduces breaking changes or deprecation notices, a detailed
document describing what changes a user needs to make will be linked below.
