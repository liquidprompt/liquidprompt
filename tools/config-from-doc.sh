usage="This tool extracts the default configuration from the documentation,
so that the resulting file can be used as a preset configuration.

Usage:
    ./tools/config-from-doc.sh [--verbose] [|â€¦|] > my_output.conf

Ex.:
    ./tools/config-from-doc.sh > default_commented.conf

It must be started from the root directory of the liquidprompt repository,
so that it finds the right documentation file.
    
By default, every key=value are commented out.
You must edit it manually to get a working configuration file.

You may enable warning about the parsing with the '--verbose' flag.
Warnings will be printed to stderr and will not appear in the output file.

The output is made so that it can be easily manipulated.
For instance if you want to get rid of comments and enable every feature:
    ./tools/config-from-doc.sh | grep '^#\S' | sed 's/=0$/=1/' > full_raw.conf
